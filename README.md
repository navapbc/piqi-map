# piqi-map
The [Patient Information Quality Improvement (PIQI)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/piqi/index.html) Framework is an evolving standard that wants to serve as a vehicle for promoting trust in the quality and clinical relevance of the healthcare data that transits our systems.

This project exists in part to promote engagement and accelerate adoption and education by providing an open source library that can be used as an approach for mapping data to the [PIQI data model](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/piqi/piqi_framework.html#piqi-data-models).  

This project relies on the [HAPI-FHIR](https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir) and [piqi-model](https://github.com/navapbc/piqi-model) libraries.

## Notice
Early days.  Needs validated for clinical accuracy.
